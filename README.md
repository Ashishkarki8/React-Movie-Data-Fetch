# Features and Concepts Used
1. **State Management with Hooks**: Utilize React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage dynamic state variables like movie queries, search results, loading indicators, and error messages efficiently.
2. **Fetching Data from API**: Access movie data from the OMDB API, enabling real-time search functionality and dynamic content updates based on user interactions.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage API request failures and provide informative error messages to users for a seamless browsing experience.
4. **Local Storage Integration**: Seamlessly store and retrieve user preferences and watched movie lists using the browser's local storage, ensuring persistent data across sessions.
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Employ conditional rendering techniques to dynamically display components based on various state variables, such as loading states, search results availability, and error occurrences.
6. **Component Composition**: Embrace modular component design principles to encapsulate specific functionalities within reusable components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
7. **Event Handling**: Implement responsive event handling mechanisms to capture user interactions, such as selecting movies, adding movies to watchlists, and deleting watched movies, enhancing user engagement and interaction.
8. **Dynamic Rendering**: Dynamically render movie details, posters, titles, release years, ratings, and runtime information fetched from the API, ensuring up-to-date and accurate content presentation.
9. **Use of Refs**: Leverage React refs to access and manipulate DOM elements, enabling seamless integration of keyboard event handling for enhanced user accessibility and navigation.
10. **CSS Styling**: Apply CSS styling techniques to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application, ensuring consistency and readability across different screen sizes and devices.
11. **Functional Programming**: Embrace functional programming paradigms to manipulate movie data efficiently using array methods like map, filter, and array destructuring, optimizing performance and code readability.
