State Management with Hooks: Utilize React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage dynamic state variables like movie queries, search results, loading indicators, and error messages efficiently.
Fetching Data from API: Access movie data from the OMDB API, enabling real-time search functionality and dynamic content updates based on user interactions.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage API request failures and provide informative error messages to users for a seamless browsing experience.
Local Storage Integration: Seamlessly store and retrieve user preferences and watched movie lists using the browser's local storage, ensuring persistent data across sessions.
Conditional Rendering: Employ conditional rendering techniques to dynamically display components based on various state variables, such as loading states, search results availability, and error occurrences.
Component Composition: Embrace modular component design principles to encapsulate specific functionalities within reusable components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
Event Handling: Implement responsive event handling mechanisms to capture user interactions, such as selecting movies, adding movies to watchlists, and deleting watched movies, enhancing user engagement and interaction.
Dynamic Rendering: Dynamically render movie details, posters, titles, release years, ratings, and runtime information fetched from the API, ensuring up-to-date and accurate content presentation.
Use of Refs: Leverage React refs to access and manipulate DOM elements, enabling seamless integration of keyboard event handling for enhanced user accessibility and navigation.
CSS Styling: Apply CSS styling techniques to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application, ensuring consistency and readability across different screen sizes and devices.
Functional Programming: Embrace functional programming paradigms to manipulate movie data efficiently using array methods like map, filter, and array destructuring, optimizing performance and code readability.
